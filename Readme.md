RTor - A JQueryUI Demo
======================
This is a demo based on some ancient Tektronics terminal hacks from many(!) years ago.
I revived them a while ago in Flash, and when Flash was starting to get passe, re-wrote them in HTML5.

The actual demo *might* keep you amused for thirty seconds or so...but the code 
does show how to use various JQueryUI elements, and serves as worked example of an 
HTML5 graphics application. I'm also using it as a way to become familiar with Github.

You can find a ready-to-run version of the code at [saccade.com/rtor](http://www.saccade.com/rtor).
The interesting JavaScript code is [here](https://github.com/isonno/rtor/blob/master/js/rtor.js).

Footnote Sep '14: Rtor actually made the top 20 in the "Hypnotic" category on [PointlessSites.com](http://www.pointlesssites.com/hypnotic.asp).  Dubious honor, yes, but I'll take it anyway.
